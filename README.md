# DOTFILES
Nothing interesting, just my dotfiles so that I can share them on multiple PCs. However if you stumbled upon this, you might be interested in my setup. And if you are not I will just say I use Arch(-based distro) btw.

## SETUP:
  Main PC:
    Garuda Linux KDE
  Laptop:
    Garuda Linux Hyprland with (caelestia)[https://github.com/caelestia-dots/shell], my beloved.

   Neovim with plugins/(kickstart.nvim)[https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim], also my beloved.
